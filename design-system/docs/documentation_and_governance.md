# Documentation and Governance

The Brook Design System relies on thorough documentation and governance to ensure consistent implementation and evolution over time. These guidelines help maintain high quality and facilitate collaboration across teams.

## Documentation Guidelines

### 1. Comprehensive Component Documentation
- Each component should have detailed documentation covering:
  - Purpose and use cases.
  - Variants and states (e.g., hover, active, disabled).
  - Accessibility considerations.
  - Code examples for implementation.

### 2. Visual and Written Guidance
- Include design specifications such as spacing, alignment, and sizing for each component.
- Provide both visual representations (e.g., Figma mockups) and written instructions for clarity.

### 3. Updates and Versioning
- Document updates or changes to components or guidelines with versioning.
- Include a changelog that tracks new features, fixes, and improvements.

### 4. Accessibility Standards
- Document all accessibility requirements, ensuring compliance with WCAG guidelines.
- Include resources and testing procedures for verifying accessibility.

## Governance Guidelines

### 1. Design System Ownership
- Assign a team or individual responsible for maintaining and evolving the design system.
- Ensure ownership includes designers, developers, and stakeholders.

### 2. Contribution Process
- Establish a clear process for contributing to the design system:
  - Proposal submission.
  - Review and approval.
  - Documentation and implementation.

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Regularly audit the design system for consistency and usability.
- Ensure components meet performance and accessibility standards before release.

### 4. Feedback and Iteration
- Actively gather feedback from users of the design system.
- Schedule periodic reviews to refine and adapt the system to new needs.
