# Colour Palette

The Brook Design System defines a structured and harmonious colour palette that reflects the calming and adaptable nature of a brook. The palette is designed to ensure clarity, consistency, and accessibility across all components.

## Colour Guidelines

### 1. Base Colours
- Establish a set of foundational colours to serve as the system's primary palette.
- Use neutral tones for backgrounds and surfaces, ensuring a clean and professional aesthetic.

### 2. Accent Colours
- Use accent colours sparingly to draw attention to key actions, states, or information.
- Ensure accent colours harmonise with the base palette without overwhelming the design.

### 3. Contrast and Accessibility
- Maintain sufficient contrast between text and background to ensure readability.
- Follow WCAG guidelines for contrast ratios (4.5:1 for body text, 3:1 for large text).

### 4. Themes
- Support both light and dark themes to adapt to user preferences and contexts.
- Ensure colours remain accessible and consistent across themes.

### 5. Gradients and Transparency
- Use gradients subtly to enhance visual depth and transitions.
- Apply transparency sparingly to maintain clarity and readability.

### 6. States and Feedback
- Define colours for interactive states such as hover, active, and disabled.
- Use consistent colours for system feedback:
  - Success: Calm and positive tones.
  - Warning: Bright but non-aggressive colours.
  - Error: Clear and attention-grabbing tones.
