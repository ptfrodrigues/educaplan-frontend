# Feedback

Feedback in the Brook Design System is designed to provide users with immediate and clear responses to their actions, ensuring intuitive and engaging interactions.

## Feedback Guidelines

### 1. Immediate Response
- Provide instant feedback for user actions, such as button presses or toggles.
- Example: Ripple effects on click or hover to mimic water ripples.

### 2. Clear States
- Define visual feedback for states such as hover, active, focus, and disabled:
  - **Hover**: Subtle highlighting or shadow changes.
  - **Active**: Increased depth or ripple effects.
  - **Disabled**: Reduced opacity and interactivity.

### 3. Error and Success Feedback
- Use colour, icons, and text to provide clear feedback for errors or successes.
- Pair visual feedback with motion, such as a shake for an error or a subtle fade-in for success messages.

### 4. Accessible Feedback
- Ensure feedback is perceivable through multiple channels, such as visual cues and screen reader announcements.
- Avoid relying solely on colour to convey status; include text or icons as supplementary indicators.
