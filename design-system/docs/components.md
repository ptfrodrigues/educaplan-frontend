# Components

The Brook Design System emphasises reusable, modular components that adapt dynamically to their containers and maintain consistency throughout the system.

## Key Guidelines for Components

### 1. Reusability
- Components should be designed as standalone, reusable units to ensure consistency across the system.
- Each component must follow design principles such as clarity, accessibility, and scalability.

### 2. Modularity
- Components should integrate seamlessly with other elements, allowing flexible assembly for various layouts and purposes.
- Break down larger components into smaller, maintainable subcomponents where necessary.

### 3. Dynamic Behaviour
- Components should adapt dynamically to their container sizes using container queries.
- Ensure components maintain proportionality and usability across varying screen sizes.

### 4. Standardisation
- Define clear rules for the size, padding, and behaviour of all components.
- Document each component with its purpose, states (e.g., active, hover, disabled), and implementation guidelines.

## Example Components
- **Buttons**: Clearly indicate primary actions with distinct visual hierarchy.
- **Cards**: Present information in a concise, modular format.
- **Forms**: Ensure accessible input fields, labels, and validation feedback.
- **Navigation**: Provide consistent and intuitive menus or breadcrumbs for seamless navigation.
- **Data Visualisation**: Use charts, graphs, and other tools to present data clearly and efficiently.
