# Design Principles

The Brook Design System is built on foundational principles to ensure consistency, adaptability, and a user-centric experience. These principles guide the development of components, layouts, and interactions.

## Key Principles

### 1. Consistency
- Maintain uniform styles, behaviours, and interactions across all components.
- Ensure design patterns are repeatable to reduce user cognitive load.

### 2. Accessibility
- Follow WCAG standards to create inclusive designs that are usable by people with diverse abilities.
- Ensure sufficient colour contrast, readable typography, and navigable interfaces.

### 3. Scalability
- Design modular components that can be reused and expanded as requirements evolve.
- Ensure the system can adapt to varying levels of complexity in data and functionality.

### 4. Performance
- Optimise designs for speed and efficiency to improve usability.
- Minimise the use of heavy resources to ensure smooth interactions across all devices.
